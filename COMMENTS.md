### Setup

- Installed axios as an additional dependancy to send http requests to the backend (API) (fetch data).

### Unit Testing Using Vitest

- Implemented a very simple and basic unit testing due to time constraints of the task. This could be extended to include a more comprehensive testing (mocking the data etc.).
- The API endpoint has been rigorously tested using Postman (integration testing) prior to consuming it in the frontend.

### Main Logic

- Most of the new code and new logic is concentrated in the two components: `Applications.tsx` and `SingleApplication.tsx`

### Other Notes & Comments

- It would be a good practice to store the API URL as an environmental variable in the .env file instead of directly consuming it in the code. But for the purposes of the task and to keep things simple, I have not done that.
